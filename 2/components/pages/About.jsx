      <p>
        Personal: Christian, Wife and Mom. These three words are what best
        describe me. Work: I'm a jack of all trades. I love to problem solve and
        provide the best product possible. Marketing: Give me a product, I can
        market it. I appreciate finding value of the compnay core - every
        business has a product and finding an audience to buy that product is my
        specialty. Photography: I've loved photography since 2015, I am
        self-taught and so confident in my craft. Web Development: As a junior
        developer, I am still gaining my confidence. This new trade gives new
        challenges to solve which I enjoy so much!
